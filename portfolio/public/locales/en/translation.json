My missions consisted of creating responsive websites connected to the EPHOTODAM software via an API. I also had the opportunity to develop some small features, participate in the design of certain modules and sites. I also worked on the scalability of a website model.\n\n The technologies I used were PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and XML, while respecting an AJAX method.",
    "description2": "For this project, it's simply my portfolio, which is the site you are currently on.\n\n The technologies used for this project are HTML, CSS, Javascript, while following a \"mobile-first\" approach. I also set up continuous deployment from a Github repository.",
    "description3": "For this project, it's the e-commerce landing page of get-touchdown, for which I created something very catchy with eye-catching effects, something creative and original.\n\n The Next.js framework was used for this project, which is hosted on Vercel. Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) have been implemented. I also linked the site to Stripe (a payment module).",
